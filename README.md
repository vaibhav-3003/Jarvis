# Chatbot using Python, Tkinter, Machine Learning, and JSON
This project is a chatbot application built using Python, Tkinter, Machine Learning, and JSON. The chatbot is designed to interact with users and provide responses to their inquiries based on the information stored in a JSON file.
## Features
The chatbot includes the following features:

* A graphical user interface built using Tkinter.
* A machine learning algorithm for natural language processing.
* A JSON file for storing the chatbot's responses and information.
* The ability to handle multiple intents and provide appropriate responses.
* An option for the user to exit the chatbot at any time.

## Getting Started
To get started with the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application with `python main.py`.

The chatbot should now be accessible through the graphical user interface.
## Usage
To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Enter a message in the input field.
2. Press the "Send" button or hit enter to submit the message.
3. The chatbot will analyze the message and provide a response based on the information stored in the JSON file.
4. Continue the conversation by entering additional messages and receiving responses from the chatbot.
5. To exit the chatbot, click the "Exit" button or close the application window.
